I am a Senior Systems Engineer  at Qamcom Research and Technology AB, where
I  develop  efficient  algorithms  for  advanced  communication  and  Joint
Communication and Sensing (JCAS) systems. My work focuses on applied linear
algebra   and   graph  theory   to   solve   complex  challenges   in   the
telecommunications industry.

I began  my academic journey  at Amrita Vishwavidyapeetham, India,  where I
received   my  Bachelor   of   Technology  (B.Tech)   in  Electronics   and
Communication  Engineering in  2013.  My bachelor's  thesis, supervised  by
[Dr. Shikha Tripathi](https://staff.pes.edu/nm1046/),  was  awarded  funding  through  the  Government  of
Karnataka's KSCST program.

In 2015,  I earned my  Master of  Science in Communication  Engineering from
Chalmers University of  Technology in Sweden. During my  master's studies, I
also served as  a research intern in the Communication  Systems Group within
the Department of Signals and Systems.   My thesis was jointly supervised by
[Prof.  Alexandre Graell i Amat](https://sites.google.com/site/agraellamat/home), [Prof.  Iryna Andriyanova](https://perso.etis-lab.fr/andriyanova/), and
[Prof.  Fredrik Brännström](https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/fredrikb/).

Following my  master's, I pursued my  doctoral studies at the  University of
Bergen and Simula UiB AS in Norway  from 2015 to 2018. Under the guidance of
[Dr. Eirik Rosnes](https://sites.google.com/a/simula.no/eirik-rosnes/home), Prof. Alexandre Graell i Amat, and [Prof. Øyvind Ytrehus](https://www4.uib.no/en/find-employees/%C3%98yvind.Ytrehus), I
completed my Ph.D.

My  primary   research  interests  include  JCAS   systems,  forward  error
correction, and information-theoretic privacy  and security for distributed
storage and computing. I have also contributed to the academic community by
serving  as a  Technical  Program Committee  (TPC)  member for  prestigious
conferences, including the IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM)
in  2020 and  the IEEE  Wireless Communications  and Networking  Conference
(WCNC) in 2021.
